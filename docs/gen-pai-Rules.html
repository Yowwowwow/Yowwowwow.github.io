<h1>gèn pái: How to Play</h1>
<p>Game link: <a href="https://yowwowwow.github.io/gen-pai">https://yowwowwow.github.io/gen-pai</a><br><br>
  Each player starts with 4 HP and 2 cards in hand.<br>
  At the start of each player's turns, they have to
  draw 2 cards, or 1 if they have 3 cards in hand, or 0 if they have 4 cards in hand.<br>
  Reduce the opponent's HP to 0 to win! It's a tie if both players' HP reach 0 simultaneously.<br>
  There are 15 cards in total.<br>
  There could be situations where both players have 4 cards in hand but can't play any. Although the game
  softlocks in this case, you can count it as a tie.<br>
  <span style="color:#ff0000">gèn</span> (4): Opponent -1 HP.<br>
  <span style="color:#ff9400">tāu gèn</span> (4): You +1 HP. (Can't play this when you have <span style="color:#10ffa5">禁回</span> debuff, or have full (4) HP.)<br>
  <span style="color:#7f00ff">互傷</span> (2): Both -1 HP.<br>
  <span style="color:#92b42d">歧視</span> (2): Give your opponent <span style="color:#92b42d">歧視</span> debuff. (They can't draw or play any card on their next turn. The debuff will be removed when they end their turn.)<br>
  <span style="color:#10ffa5">禁回</span> (2): Give your opponent <span style="color:#10ffa5">禁回</span> debuff. (Can't play this when they already have it.)<br>
  <span style="color:#ff7810">燒燬</span> (1): Remove all cards and debuffs from both players.
